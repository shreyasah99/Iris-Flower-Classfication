# Iris-Flower-Classfication
Iris flower classifier model using Decision tree algorithm

Iris.csv  is the dayaset

iris- spark.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file which contians code for data pre-processing and the model and we obtain accuracy of 93.33%.

Also I have made front-end web application for the model where user can input values for features and get class of flowerr for that value .
I did this using streamlit package and iris.py contains code for same.

Later model was deployed on Heroku cloud.
